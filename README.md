# wordpress-googlead-shortcode
A cool customizable Wordpress shortcode for Google Ads

This code can be added to your Wordpress theme's functions.php file and will enable you to use this shortcode throughout your Wordpress website. 

The neat thing about this shortcode, is that it uses your Google Adsense code, but allows you to feed values via the shortcode, so that you can display different Google Ad formats depending on where you are using the shortcode. 

For example, you can pass the vertical value to the shortcode when you want to display a vertical ad in your side bar, or you can pass the horizontal value to the shortcode when you want to display a horizontal google ad (for example in-line in your blog content). Or you can simply leave it set to auto, and let Google decide. 

So rather than just a standard shortcode that provides the same code throughout, this can be modified based on how you want to use the shortcode.
